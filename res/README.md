Here's how to use the scraper:

`python3 -m venv venv`

`source venv/bin/activate`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

`python playlist_scraper.py`

The script will take around 10-15 mins to run, depending on your internet connection.
It gathers 40-50 songs for each genre.  You can run it multiple times, and it will skip songs that have already been downloaded.
